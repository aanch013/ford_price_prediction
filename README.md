# Ford Price Prediction
In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of Ford F-150 vehicles using historical the features from the data, such as year, condition, and color. After cleaning the data and narrowing down on which columns to focus on, I implemented the K-Nearest Neighbors model to predict  the selling price of Ford F-150 vehicles according to their values for year, condition, odometer, sellingprice. At the end, I plotted the actual vs predicted points, which showed a linear relationship, indicating that the model had high accuracy in its predictions.
